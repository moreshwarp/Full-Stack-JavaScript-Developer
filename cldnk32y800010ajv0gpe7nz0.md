# Introduction to Local Storage

**LocalStorage** is used to store the data in the browser for a particular domain.

Basically i.e **<mark>local storage</mark>** is a web storage object which is not sent to the server with each request. Whereas the cookie is been set to the server with each request.

An where the developer doesn't want to send the data to the server with every request.

Suppose you want to **save** the note from the **client** and you don't want that note to get stored in **cookie** 🍪 the reason you don't want to store that note in cookie 🍪 is that that note then is sent to the server for **every request call**.
