Remember the saying: 'Motivation gets you started, discipline keeps you going.' People often overlook the fact that motivation is a fleeting emotion. This leads them to quit before they see any results.

In life, sports, relationships—winning comes from not giving up. Once you understand the game you're playing, your goal is to keep playing so you can outlast everyone. And this can only be achieved through discipline.

The first step on this journey is to define success. Trust me, success doesn't care about your feelings. It only cares about you showing up every day and putting in the work. That's what truly matters.

Many think they need motivation, inspiration, or energy to start working. But that's not how it works. The more you act, the more you become inspired to improve each day. You build momentum, making it easier to keep going.

So, next time you don't feel like working, I suggest not giving in to your feelings. Start doing. Action creates momentum. Once you're on the bike, you won't want to get off after just five minutes. This concept applies to everything in life.

The only certainty in life is that it will test you, not once or twice, but a hundred times. It's up to you to decide how you want to play the game, because nothing is handed to you; you'll have to earn it. Sometimes you won't see results, sometimes you'll feel lost, and sometimes things will go against you.

Be grateful for these challenges. Expand your time horizon, trust the process, and keep grinding. Only the hungriest will reach the top, not the most intelligent or gifted.

Today's society has made us dependent on instant gratification. We seek pleasure and forget that it's through delayed gratification that we truly test ourselves—our patience, discipline, and determination.

So keep putting in the work, even on the days when it feels like everything is falling apart. Stay consistent and keep stacking those hard-working days for a decade. That's how you win.

'Fortitudine vincimus.' - Those who endure conquer."**​

​**Keep showing up, keep inspiring, keep working.
