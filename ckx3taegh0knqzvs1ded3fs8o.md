# Role of JS in web programing

JavaScript is a **High-Level**, **Object-Oriented**, **Multi-Paradigm** programming language used on both client-side and server side, which allows you to build complex features in the webpage.

Also allows you to play with API both browser and 3rd party APIs (Twitter API, Google Maps API) a complex code, A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface, via the Document Object Model API.

It helps avoid the traffic on servers i.e the repetition of the request-response cycle.

### High Level

You don't have to worry about memory management for variables you create, based on Object storing data instruct \*\*OS \*\*to do things.

### Multi Paradigms

We can use different styles of programming

In simple words, JS is the \*\*verb \*\*in the sentence, whereas, HTML is **Noun** and CSS is the **adjective**.

### Light Weight

JS is a lightweight interpreted programming language. The web browser receives the JavaScript code in its original text form and runs the script from that.

### Interpreted Language

JS is still considered an **interpreted language** since the compilation is handled at run time, rather than ahead of time.

You can manipulate the events on a web page with just a few lines of JS.

### ECMA

ECMA International set the standards for JS after 2015 there are and shall be yearly releases of ES modules.

You just need the latest browser to execute the JS code nothing more, which off-course pretty much basic.

### Compatibility

JS is **Backwards compatible** which follows don't break the web, which means the code of 2001 would be executed in the browser developed in 2021 but vice-a-versa won't be possible i.e JS code from 2021 won't be executed in the browser from 2001, say JS is not forward compatible.

Hence old features are never removed.

### Fun fact

**Brendan Eich** developed this wonderful language in 10 days.
