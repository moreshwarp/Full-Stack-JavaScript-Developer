# Input Elements in HTML

`Form` in HTML are the interactive documents, which will help to collect the data from the user. It also has various attributes like `action`, `autocomplete`, `method` (`get`,`post`, `dialog`).

`action` : Here there will be the URL where the form data will be `submitted`/`collected`.

`autocomplete`: Here the value is `on`/`off`. It will allow the browser automatically complete the entries.

`method`: `HTTP` method to `submit` the form with. The only allowed methods/values are

* `post` : The <mark>Post</mark> method; form data is been sent as a request body.
    
* `get` (default): The <mark>GET</mark> method from data appended to the action URL with a `?` the separator <mark>uses </mark> this method when the form has no side effects.
    
* `dialog` : When the form method has `dialog` , then closes the dialog and throws a submit event on submission without submitting data or clearing the form.
    
* `novalidate` : Indicates that the form should not be `validated`, <mark>its attribute is not set</mark> and because of this by default the form is <mark>validated</mark>. However, this can be overridden by calling and method and applying a validation using JS\*\*.\*\*
