# Flexbox

## Background

The Flexbox provide the efficient way to lay out and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic hence the word **flex** came into picture.

It gives a container an ability to alter its items i.e. its **width**, **height ** and **order** to the best fill available space.

The flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrink them to prevent overflow.

Flexbox is appropriate to the component of an application, and small scale layouts.

## Flexbox Specifications

Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties.

And some of these properties are to set for container and some of these are to be set for flex children i.e. *flex items*.

### Points to be noted.

1. The item in the container will be laid out in across  main axis or cross axis.

2. Main axis may not always be horizontal.

3. Items are placed in between main start and main end.

4. cross axis is always perpendicular to the main axis.
 
## Properties of Flexbox

In an example below we have all the properties of flex-box i.e. Container (Parent) and Children (Flex Items).
 
### diplay: flex

Syntax: `display: flex` 

This is being applied to the parent container,  and it will arrange all the elements in row, which are present in the container.

### flex-direction

Syntax:  `flex-direction: row (default)| column | row-reverse | column-reverse`

This will define the direction of the flex i.e. it would define the main axis and cross axis of the flexbox container.

Here, these properties would work in these format.

- **row**: would be its default property and would arrange the elements in left to right.

- **row-reverse**: would arrange the items in right to left, and left to right in rtl.

- **column**: would arrange items in same row but top to bottom.

- **column-reverse**: would arrange item in single column, but in a reverse direction.


## flex-wrap

Syntax:  `flex-wrap: no-wrap| wrap | wrap-reverse`

By default the flex items will all try to fit in one line. You can change and allow the items to wrap as needed using this property. 

**nowrap** : It would be the default property,  

**wrap** : All the flex items will wrap into multiple lines from top to bottom.

**wrap-reverse** : All the flex items will wrap into multiple lines from bottom to top.

### flex-flow

Syntax: `flex-flow: flex-direction flex-wrap`

This is an shorthand property for flex direction and flex wrap, and its default values are row and wrap.

##justify-content

Syntax: 
`justify-content: flex-start | center | flex-end | space-evenly | space-around| space-between | left | right | safe | unsafe`

Consider you are making the changes on x-axis of coordinate systems

- `flex-start`:  is the default value items are placed from start of the container.

- `flex-end` : Items are placed towards the end of container.

- `center` : Items are place at the center of the container.

- `space-around` : Items are placed evenly and will occupy whole space of the container.

- `space-between` : Item are placed in such a way that they are evenly distributed within 
     the  container.

- `space-evenly` :  Items are place in such a way that the spacing between the two items 
    are equal.
   
## align-items

Syntax: `align-items: flex-start | flex-end | center | stretch (default)| baseline `

- `stretch` : Will fill the container with max-width.

- `flex-start` :  Items are placed at the start (+ve) across y axis here we can say cross axis.

- `flex-end` : Items are placed and the bottom of y axis i.e. cross axis.

- `center` : Items are at the centered in the cross axis.

- `baseline`: items are aligned such as their baselines align

## align-content

Syntax: `align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | stretch (default)| space-around | space- evenly`

This aligns the individual items based on the cross-axis i.e. vertically depending on the flex-direction.

## gap property in flexbox

 `gap, row-gap, column-gap` 

Gap also know as gutters and tracks, it controls the space in-between the items.  

## Flex items or Children of the containers

**order**: They control the order in which the items appears in the flex-container. 

**flex-grow** : Provide the ability if an flex-items needs to grow and its default value is `1`, 
    `flex-grow: 1` the respect child will take place the space as per the value provided and 
     rest space will be distributed equally.

**flex-shrink** : It defines the ability to shrink the respective flex-item if required here, 
    negative number is invalid. Default value is 0.

**flex-basis** :  It define the space of the item before the remaining space is distributed for 
                            other elements. default value is auto.

## flex

Syntax:
 `flex: flex-grow | flex-shrink | flex-basis`

**flex**: This is short hand property,  grow, shrink and basis.

Syntax:  
```flex: none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]```


## align-self

Syntax:
 `align-self:  auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;`

This allows to override the `align-items` for an individual elements,  

**Note**: The float, vertical-align, have no effect on flex items.
