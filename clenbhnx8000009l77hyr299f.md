# What is the Internet, Web Browser, Browser Engine, Static site, Dynamic site?

# What is the Internet?

The Internet is the collection of networks or networks connected worldwide. It gives the information available across the globe with a `single click` or a stroke of the keyboard.

Also, communication among the computer takes place with the help of a set of instructions called protocols. i.e. network protocol and hardware.

All the information across is converted into binary i.e. `0's` and `1's`. The main difference between `Internet` and `world wide web` is that internet is an infrastructure and the world wide web is a `service` on top of it.

# What is Web Browser?

The web browser helps you to browse information across the internet and this information is in the form of *text*, *images*, *video*, *software* i.e `code` etc.

There are various other things that the browser does, that help to initiate requests and response cycles.

It's not only about text and images information we can access via. browser but

1. Generate lighthouse reports.
    
2. API Calls.
    
3. Help to store data in your local, session and cookie storages.
    
4. Helps to debug the code, and set up breaking points.
    
5. Monitors the performances of websites by calculating the load time etc.
    
6. Helps to record your experiences etc.
    
7. Helps to `secure/privacy` a mode of interaction with the internet.
    
8. It also has various other APIs which help build other things.
    

# What is a Browser Engine? How does it work?

The browser engine is the core software component that transforms the incoming data (`HTML DOC. and other recourse`) into the webpage as the device where the URL has been entered in the browser which the user sees on screen.

Now, technically there are 2 types of engines.

1. **Rendering** or **Layout Engine**
    
2. **Browser Engine**
    

The browser engine communicates i.e. it makes a required system call between the **Render** or **Layout Engine** and **Browser User Interface**.

So the Browser Engines handle the communication between the above two,

<mark>The browser engine, rendering engine, and JavaScript engine are all essentially working together to get raw web code into a viewable and usable form inside your browser.</mark>

Below are some of the references for **Browser Engines**.

1. **<mark>Gecko</mark>**: It's a Mozilla browser engine. **<mark>Goanna</mark>** also is a fork of Gecko used in the Pale Moon browser.
    
2. **<mark>Webkit</mark>**: Created by Apple for its Safari browser, by forking the KHTML engine of the KDE project.
    
    **<mark>Google</mark>** also used WebKit for its **<mark>Chrome browser</mark>**, but eventually forked it to create the **<mark>Blink engine</mark>**.
    
3. **<mark>Blink engine</mark>:** All Chromium-based browsers use Blink, as do applications built with CEF, Electron, or any other framework that embeds Chromium.
    
4. **<mark>Trident and EdgeHTML</mark>:** **<mark>Microsoft</mark>** developed its proprietary browser engines.
    
5. **Servo:** It's an experimental browser engine by **<mark>Mozilla</mark>**.
    

## How do Browser Engines Work?

The engine is like a **translator**, turning the **raw code** that you canâ€™t understand into an understandable format i.e. `Web Page`.

<mark>It is because of Browser Engine that the page load, render and work differently in a different browser.</mark>

**Browser engines** contain special pieces of code called ***parsers*** that <mark>convert data from one format into another that the browser holds in its memory</mark>.

And in memory, the data is called a **Document Object Model** *DOM.* The **DOM** and the computed styles are fed into a **layout or Render engine** that takes into account the size of the window being drawn into.

The **layout or Render engine** uses various **algorithms** to take each element and **draw a box** that will hold its content and take into account all the styles applied to it.

When the layout is complete, the engine turns the blueprint of the page into the part you see. This process is known as **<mark>painting</mark>**.

Google can help narrow down what you're looking for with specialized searches. It uses a **special algorithm to determine its search results.**

It also uses **automated programs** called **spiders** or **crawlers**, just like most search engines, to help generate its search results. Google has a large index of keywords that help determine search results.

<mark>Google also uses a trademarked algorithm called PageRank, which assigns each Web page a relevancy score.</mark>

The best way to make sure your Web page is high on Google's search results is to provide **great content** **so that other sites will link to your page**.

**The more links your page gets, the higher its PageRank score will be**.

If you attract the attention of sites with a high PageRank score, your score will grow faster.

# What are Static Sites?

The Static website which is been developed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JavaScript libraries can.

Here is a pre-built HTML, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** code is been rendered, and the content is not going to change at frequent intervals.

Some of these examples are any school, clubs websites etc. As these websites do not request the data from the server and hence they can be also called **lightweight**.

Here are some features of static sites **<mark>Simplicity</mark>**, **<mark>Speed</mark>**, **<mark>Security</mark>**, **<mark>Cost Effective</mark>**, and **<mark>scalability</mark>**.

No sensitive information or data is been added to these websites, they can handle a lot of web traffic.

Hence, its security maintenance is less compared to a dynamic one.

You don't have to set up the server for managing the data from the **CMS**, **Database**.

Also, these websites have limited functionality, less flexibility, and minimum user interaction, hence complex implementation is not possible.

# What are Dynamic Sites?

Websites, where the data is constantly updated for these dynamic websites have a dedicated server from where this data is been fetched from these, are very powerful websites or web applications where the user experience is always a 1st priority.

Some of the examples for these websites are `Netflix`, `Hotstar`, `News Websites`, `Amazon`, Spotify etc.

These sites also have a database where user data can be collected and stored for future reference and to enhance the user experience.

We have a wide variety of features over here, it includes very complex features that solve actual problems from day-to-day life.

**<mark>Business Logic is been stored on the server side</mark>.**

**Features for Dynamic websites are as below.**

* `Flexibility`: Fetch the data from the server and roll it out for the user.
    
* `User Interactions`: This is very high and helps websites to add more features.
    
* `Better SEO`: Giver us better search engine optimizations.
    
* `Scaliabitly`: Websites able to handle a lot of traffic.
    
* `Advanced Functionality`: You can design a website where people can code, etc these complex features can be added using Dynamic websites.
    

**Disadvantages of Dynamic Websites**

* A lot of overhead for simple applications, a large cost to maintain, and complexity for architecture are very high.
