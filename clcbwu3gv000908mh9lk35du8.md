# HTML Elements

The main tag in HTML is **<mark>&lt;html&gt;</mark>** which is the root of all the tags among the tags present for any webpage. It's also known as the root element and in this case, all other elements would be the decedent of the root i.e. &lt;html&gt; element.

This **<mark>&lt;html&gt;</mark>** is then been divided into 2 i.e. <mark>&lt;head&gt;</mark> and <mark>&lt;body&gt;</mark>. Let's talk about MetaData, as it contains all the information regarding the such as styling scripting and also helps to connect with the page (i.e. *external resources*) ***<mark>CSS.</mark>***

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
// It encodes most common characters, basics numbers,english with 8 // bits. 
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
//
    <title>Html Elements</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- HTML Elements -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## Sectioning Root

It also knows as `<body></body>` tag which consists of all the content which is going to render on the web page.

## Content sectioning

This allows you to organize the document logically, which helps to create the logical structure for the content on your web page, including header, footer, navigation and headline elements to identify the content.

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong><mark>Elements</mark></strong></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong><mark>Descriptions</mark></strong></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Describes the section that has been quoted from another source.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>&lt;dd&gt;</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Provides the description, definition or value of proceeding terms.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>It is a generic container for content flow, it has not to effect on elements unless CSS is applied to it.

What is Lorem Ipsum?
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
```

You can add this text at any point in time to respective tags as and when required.
